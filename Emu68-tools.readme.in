Architecture: m68k-amigaos
Type:         util/misc

This is a collection of tools, the SDK, and drivers usable with Emu68 and
PiStorm. It is an attempt to automate the build and packaging of the older
Emu68 tools in a new way. Because of this, some components may still be 
missing and will appear in future releases.

The archive currently includes the following items:

Authored by Michal Schulz:
- EmuControl
- VideoCore.card
- SetClockI2C

Contriutions by Philippe CARPENTIER:
- Emu68Reset
- Emu68Info
- Emu68EDID
- WaitUntilConnected
- ListDeviceTree

Apart from the tools listed above, the archive contains the SDK (headers
and SFD files) for resources and/or libraries used in combination with
Emu68:
- devicetree.resource
- mailbox.resource
- unicam.resource
